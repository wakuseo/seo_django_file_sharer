# seo_django_file_share
An Instagram-like project where you can upload images, caption them, and share the link with people or possibly use it as a service to get your clients to upload images for your SEO Analysts or SEO Copywriters.
In this project tackled everything from Django basic model to more advanced concepts like installing and using 3rd party packages. Be warned â€” you NEED to know Python in order to write Django. This is very important. 
And there's an added emphasis on Python classes because we'll be writing a lot of those.
